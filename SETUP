1. Install Ubuntu
    https://ubuntu.com/download/server (22.04.2 LTS)

    The installer has an option to install docker, that is fine.
    Otherwise, you can follow step 2.

    Note that you can also install the Desktop version, but it 
    doesn't have the option to install Docker, so you will have 
    to manually install Docker

2. Install Docker
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

3. clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/melpeln/bluex_interview.git

4. go into repo

5. run commands (YOU CAN START FROM HERE)
    sudo docker build -t playwright-docker .
    sudo docker run -it playwright-docker:latest npm run test
